    "* Initially thought I would use 1 RNN based model for making predictions\n",
    "    * But in order to do this I would have to onehot encode the meter_id's (as ordinal would apply a linear relation between id's which doesn't exist)\n",
    "        * This would add an extra 3500 features and hence make the solution space sufficiently sparse that it is likely our model would give any sort of reasonable performance\n",
    "        \n",
    "* My next thought was that instead I could create a separate RNN based model for each of the meters\n",
    "    * Issue is the time complexity of doing so: even if each model only takes 1 minute to run (of which it is likely they will take longer) that would be 2.4 days of continuous computation\n",
    "        * And this would have to be repeated for hyperparameter tuning and changes to the model and methodology\n",
    "            * Very impractical especially considering time constraint of the competition\n",
    "            \n",
    "* My plan is to compromise between the 2 by clustering similar time series patterns and having a separate model for making predictions for each of the similar patterns\n",
    "    * May still have problems with the size of the onehot encoded variables\n",
    "    * Will also have problem with missing variables as will soon see\n",

    "* The best we can get is a minimum of 11 missing values per day for the last 28 days of the year\n",
    "    * This is likely as the battery in the meter has died.\n",
    "* Before that it goes up exponentially making it impractical to use any more days than the last 28\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Perhaps we can make a prediction of what those last 28 days are and now we have 0 missing values for last 28 days\n",
    "    * and can generate and inspect clusters based upon this?\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Questions are:\n",
    "    * 1. just because they have similar patterns in december, are they likely to have similar patterns year round?\n",
    "        * eg is this enough data to make a real conclusion on\n",
    "    * 2. is it a good idea as the predicted values may not be accurate\n",
    "    * 3. Obviously also will have to inspect and experiment with different amounts of clusters\n",
    "    * 4. May also still have an issue with the onehot encoding if one cluster has too many assigned meters\n",
    "        * so may be forced to use a different model\n",
    "        * could maybe get around this with a keras embedding layer\n",
