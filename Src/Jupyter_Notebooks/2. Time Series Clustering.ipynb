    "# 2. Time Series Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initially thought I would use 1 RNN based model for making predictions\n",
    "    * But in order to do this I would have to onehot encode the meter_id's (as ordinal would apply a linear relation between id's which doesn't exist)\n",
    "        * This would add an extra 3500 features and hence make the solution space sufficiently sparse that it is likely our model would give any sort of reasonable performance\n",
    "        \n",
    "* My next thought was that instead I could create a separate RNN based model for each of the meters\n",
    "    * Issue is the time complexity of doing so: even if each model only takes 1 minute to run (of which it is likely they will take longer) that would be 2.4 days of continuous computation\n",
    "        * And this would have to be repeated for hyperparameter tuning and changes to the model and methodology\n",
    "            * Very impractical especially considering time constraint of the competition\n",
    "            \n",
    "* My plan is to compromise between the 2 by clustering similar time series patterns and having a separate model for making predictions for each of the similar patterns\n",
    "    * May still have problems with the size of the onehot encoded variables\n",
    "    * Will also have problem with missing variables as will soon see\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * If this proves impractical will instead consider models which can better handle categorical values such as decision tree based methods"
